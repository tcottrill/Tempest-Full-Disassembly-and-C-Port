/* c012294.h - portable Atari C012294 (POKEY) core, plain C11.
 *
 * Provides audio, RANDOM, timers/IRQs, serial, keyboard and optional POT counters
 * inputs through an optional ad_pokey_host callback interface. Derived
 * from AAE's POKEY core; see c012294.c for attribution.
 *
 * Time model
 * ----------
 * ad_pokey_advance() is the only API that advances machine time. Pass
 * elapsed POKEY master-clock cycles before register accesses. Reads and
 * writes consume no cycles; repeated RANDOM reads without an advance
 * return the same byte. Convert CPU cycles in the host when clocks differ.
 * Advance every chip on a board from the same machine timeline.
 *
 * Machine events are processed one clock at a time, preserving callback
 * deadlines across different advance batch sizes (runs of clocks with no
 * event are stepped together with identical results; see quiet_span()). SKCTL init changes
 * RANDOM feedback rather than stopping its clock. It resets and freezes
 * the shared slow clocks; fast timers continue to count. AUDF writes
 * affect reload values, not the active count. IRQEN gates interrupt
 * latching without restarting timers or their source clocks.
 *
 * Audio comes from the same timeline: advance generates samples from the
 * same counters (the chip's DAC, see ad_pokey_set_measured_audio) and
 * render drains completed samples (silence on underrun); audio_read returns
 * only available samples. There is no separate audio clock.
 *
 * Keep board addresses, CPU scheduling, audio devices and DIP mapping in
 * the host adapter. See docs/POKEY-PORTING.md for integration guidance
 * and current model limitations. The ad_ API prefix is retained for
 * compatibility with existing hosts.
